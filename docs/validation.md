# Local validation record

Run dates: 2026-10-23–24 (Asia/Shanghai). Environment: Windows, Python 3.13.16. Version: 0.1.0. This dated record describes the local checks before initial publication.

- Unit/integration suite: **28 tests passed**.
- Combined statement/branch coverage: **96.8%**.
- Ruff check and format check passed.
- Bandit: no medium/high findings.
- Wheel and source distribution built successfully with setuptools 84.2.1.
- Built wheel installed in a brand-new virtual environment; version and actual demo ran; uninstall and import-absence verification passed.

Commands are in CONTRIBUTING.md and scripts/verify_install.py. Tests use synthetic data, not user files. CI is configured for Linux/Windows/macOS and Python 3.11/3.13. See the [actual Actions runs](https://github.com/KanadeK/jsonl-rescue/actions) for remote results and the release notes for the verified initial-release run. Local results alone do not establish other-platform compatibility.

Direct runtime/build requirements and the complete resolved local quality environment were checked with pip-audit 2.10.1; final scans found no known vulnerabilities. The prior setuptools 80.9.0 pin hit GHSA-h35f-9h28-mq5c and was replaced before shipping. Vulnerability databases change; this is a dated result, not a permanent guarantee.

Extra review: 150 deterministic randomized exact-byte split/reassembly round trips passed.
